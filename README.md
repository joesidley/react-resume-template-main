View a [live demo here.](https://react-resume-template-main-zeta.vercel.app/)

If you would like to bootstrap this code yourself, download the entire repo, and move in the command line to the 'react-resume-template-main' directory location

then call yarn install

then yarn run dev

then navigate to localhost:3000



NB: I ran out of time to add the "Get In Touch" email form sending functionality (due to university commitments to do with my final exam) so that is as of yet non-functional
